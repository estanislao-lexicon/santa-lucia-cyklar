### Optional tasks

1. The client wants a contact form that sends an email (redacted).
2. The client wants her users subscribing to a email list, so is requesting to create a section in the Home page or inside the footer.


### Hints for the project

1. You can use any logotype for the project or use the official one.
2. You can use her color scheme or invent one using https://coolors.co
3. You can use any cupcake or bakery social media accounts for the links in the footer. In case you want to use the official ones these are the links: Instagram and Facebook.
4. For the text information on the web-page you can pick one of the 2 options:
	1. Copy it any other bakery website.
	2. Use the information in the annex on the last page of this document. (Google translated from Spanish, feel free to correct any grammar mistakes)
5. For the products, you can browse her Instagram account for pictures or search any from unplash.com. For the title and prices just write anything.
6. Use Google Fonts to obtain nice fonts.
7. Don’t use emojis. They work for Instagram post and nerdy HTML exercises but they don’t professional on a website.
8. For the extra tasks, you can look at how to integrate readily to use solutions like the ones provided in Mailchimp (free, but requires creating an account)


### About mobile menus

You don’t need to implement a special mobile menu.

❌ You don’t need to implement a hamburger menu button. (3 lines icon) Because they either need JavaScript or more practice CSS for more hours 
you currently have.

✅ For this project you can get by putting the menu links like the picture above. You can choose any other way to display the links.
